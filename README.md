# PIC Catcher

Game developed with Proteus.

## Introduction
Welcome to PIC Catcher, a fun and challenging game where you must catch falling objects called "PICs" to earn points and avoid losing lives. This README will provide you with all the information you need to play the game.

## Screens
### Welcome Screen
When you launch Proteus, you will be greeted by a welcome screen. This screen sets the stage for your adventure.

### Guide and Instructions
To ensure you're ready for the challenge, there is a guide and instructions screen. Here, you will find valuable information about the game's mechanics and objectives.

### Countdown Screen
Before the real game begins, you will encounter a countdown screen that prepares you for the action.

## Gameplay
Difficulty Levels
Proteus offers four different difficulty levels:

* Easy
* Medium
* Hard
* Insane (almost impossible)

The first PIC that falls always starts in the "Easy" difficulty, allowing you to familiarize yourself with the controls.

### Changing Difficulty
As you progress through the game, the speed at which the PICs fall will change. However, this change only applies to the next PIC that falls from the sky. This dynamic adjustment of the falling speed enhances gameplay comfort and keeps you on your toes.

### Scoring
You earn 1 point for each PIC you successfully catch.

### Lives
You start the game with 3 lives. Each time a PIC hits the ground without being caught, you lose a life.

### Victory and Defeat
To win the game, you must accumulate 5 points. You lose the game if you run out of lives (reach 0 lives). In either case, the game will display a corresponding screen to conclude your gaming session.
